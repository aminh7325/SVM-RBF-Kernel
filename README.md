# SVM-RBF-Kernel
In this project, I implement my algorithm concerning Newton's method to use a support vector machine for data segmentation. Then I compare my results with the ones derived by a standard solver. My results have a 5% error from the results of the standard solver.

Below is a picture of the result of my algorithm:
